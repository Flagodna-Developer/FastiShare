## 🚀 How It Works
1. **Devices connect** to the same Wi-Fi/LAN network.  
2. **FastiShare creates** a local web server on the sender’s device.  
3. **Receiver accesses** files via:  
   - A generated local IP link (e.g., `http://192.168.1.10:8080`)  
   - **QR code scan** (for quick access on mobile)  
4. **Files transfer directly** between devices—no cloud or external servers.

## 🔒 Privacy & Security
- **No Data Collected** – FastiShare doesn’t store, upload, or log your files.  
- **Local Network Only** – Only devices on your Wi-Fi/LAN can access transfers.  
- **Temporary Storage** – Files are deleted after the session ends.

## ⚡ Performance Tips
- Use **5GHz Wi-Fi** for faster speeds (2.4GHz works but is slower).  
- Keep devices **awake and close to the router** during transfer.  
- For large files, avoid network-heavy tasks (e.g., streaming).
