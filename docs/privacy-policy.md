 # FastiShare Privacy Policy  
*Last Updated: [02 May 2025]*  

FastiShare ("the App") is designed to respect your privacy. This policy explains what data we collect (spoiler: almost none) and how we handle it.  

## 🔍 Data Collection  
FastiShare **does not**:  
- Store, upload, or log your files.  
- Require registration or personal information.  
- Track your activity outside the app.  

### What We *Do* Access (And Why):

- **Network Info** *(Local IP)*  
  • **Purpose:** To create a server for file transfers  
  • **Stored?:** No (temporary)

- **File Metadata** *(e.g., filename, size)*  
  • **Purpose:** To display files for sharing  
  • **Stored?:** No (deleted after transfer)

- **App Crash Logs**  
  • **Purpose:** Debugging (if you opt-in)  
  • **Stored?:** Optional


## 🌐 Network & Permissions  
- **Wi-Fi/LAN Access**: Required to transfer files locally.  
- **Storage Permission**: Only to access files you explicitly choose to share.  

## 🛡️ Security  
- **All transfers** occur over your local network—no files pass through external servers.  
- **No encryption** is applied (since transfers are local), but only devices on your network can access the server.  

## 📊 Third-Party Services  
FastiShare uses zero:  
- No analytics (e.g., Google Analytics).  
- No ads or trackers.  

## 🧑⚖️ Compliance  
- **GDPR/CCPA**: Not applicable (we don’t collect personal data).  
- **Children’s Privacy**: The App is not intended for users under 13.  

## 📝 Changes to This Policy  
Updates will be posted here. Major changes will be notified in-app.
